## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Complete Software Architecture Document ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md))
- Plan review and optimisation record ([docs/architecture/00-plan-review.md](docs/architecture/00-plan-review.md))
- AI context engineering strategy ([AI_CONTEXT.md](AI_CONTEXT.md)) and root [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)
- 30 module specifications with the nine-file documentation set each
- 20 Architecture Decision Records
- Repository conventions: coding, API, database, errors, logging, testing, security, observability
- Prompt library design, development and runtime ([PROMPT_LIBRARY.md](PROMPT_LIBRARY.md))
- Dependency register with alternatives and rationale ([DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md))
- Delivery roadmap through Phase 5 ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md))
- Module documentation generator (`tools/docgen`) with drift checking
- Module boundary enforcement configuration (`.go-arch-lint.yml`)
- Configuration reference (`.env.example`) and `Makefile`
- The `core` identity schema: `users`, `profiles`, `user_preferences`, `learning_profiles`
- `GET` and `PATCH /api/v1/me` — read and update your own profile
- `GET` and `PUT /api/v1/me/preferences` — read and replace your own settings
- Roles and permissions: the `core` tables, the seeded two-role catalogue, and the guard
- `GET /api/v1/me/permissions` — what the caller is allowed to do
- `GET /api/v1/admin/roles`, and granting and revoking a user's roles
- The append-only audit trail: `audit_logs` and `security_events`, partitioned by month, with
  the application role holding `INSERT` and `SELECT` and nothing else
- `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs` and `GET /api/v1/admin/security-events` — search the trail and
  the security feed, filtered and paged
- `POST /api/v1/admin/security-events/{id}/resolve` — mark an event triaged, with a required
  reason
- An outbox consumer that turns the events `user` and `rbac` already publish into audit
  entries, exactly once per event
- Scheduled partition rotation and two-year retention

### Notes

The four `/me` operations and the three `/admin` audit operations are specified and implemented
but not yet reachable: nothing mounts them, and there is no authentication to put a caller in
the request context. Both arrive in Phase 1 (P1.5 and P2.4). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Audit entries record **which fields changed, not what they changed to**, and redact anything on
the PII deny-list if a value is supplied. An audit log holding a copy of every old display name
would be a second store of personal data with a longer retention period than the first. Client
addresses are stored as a keyed HMAC and never in the clear.

## How to write an entry

| Section | Use for |
|---|---|
| **Added** | New features and capabilities |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing behaviour |
| **Deprecated** | Soon-to-be-removed features, with a sunset date |
| **Removed** | Features removed in this release |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes |
| **Security** | Vulnerability fixes — always call these out explicitly |
| **Breaking** | Anything requiring action from a client or operator |
| **Migration notes** | What an operator must do when deploying this version |

Write from the reader's point of view: *"Essay feedback now streams as it is generated"*,
not *"refactor writing grading to use SSE"*. The commit log already says the second thing.

Every user-visible change gets an entry under `Unreleased` **in the same pull request** that
makes the change. Adding them at release time means half of them are missed.
