## How to write an entry

| Section | Use for |
|---|---|
| **Added** | New features and capabilities |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing behaviour |
| **Deprecated** | Soon-to-be-removed features, with a sunset date |
| **Removed** | Features removed in this release |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes |
| **Security** | Vulnerability fixes — always call these out explicitly |
| **Breaking** | Anything requiring action from a client or operator |
| **Migration notes** | What an operator must do when deploying this version |

Write from the reader's point of view: *"Essay feedback now streams as it is generated"*,
not *"refactor writing grading to use SSE"*. The commit log already says the second thing.

Every user-visible change gets an entry under `Unreleased` **in the same pull request** that
makes the change. Adding them at release time means half of them are missed.
