# cache — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| go-redis or rueidis? | go-redis v9 | Maturity and instrumentation; rueidis is faster and supports client-side caching — revisit if Redis latency becomes a measured problem |
| Typed facade or raw client? | Typed facade | It is the only way to enforce key conventions, degradation and metrics consistently; a raw client in 20 modules produces 20 conventions |
