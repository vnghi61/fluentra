# listening — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Count plays on the client or the server? | Server | Anything the client enforces alone is not enforced; exam realism depends on the limit being real |
| Reveal the transcript when? | After submission by default, configurable per activity | Seeing the transcript first turns a listening exercise into a reading exercise |
<!-- END GENERATED: decisions -->
