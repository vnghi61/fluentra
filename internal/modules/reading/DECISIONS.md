# reading — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Where do reading questions live? | In `questionbank`, referenced here | The same item is reusable in an exam; duplicating it would let the two copies diverge and break item statistics |
| Measure reading speed how? | First render to reading-complete | Including question time would conflate reading with reasoning and make the metric useless for progress |
<!-- END GENERATED: decisions -->
