# exam — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Client or server timing? | Server, always | Client timing is trivially manipulable, and an exam whose timing can be manipulated has no value as practice |
| Auto-invalidate on integrity signals? | No — record and show | False positives (a notification, a second monitor) would penalise honest learners; the signal is more useful as self-awareness feedback than as enforcement |
| Store or recompute score reports? | Store | A learner's past band must not change because we revised a conversion table |
