# vocabulary — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Lemma-level or sense-level learning? | Sense-level | Conflating senses teaches the wrong thing and makes scheduling meaningless for polysemous words, which are precisely the difficult ones |
| Generate example sentences at request time? | No — generate at authoring time and review them | Latency, cost, and above all correctness: an unreviewed example can teach a wrong collocation to thousands of learners |
