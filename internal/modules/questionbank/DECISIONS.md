# questionbank — Decisions

Module-local decisions. Anything that affects other modules, adds a dependency, or changes a
contract belongs in a repository-level ADR instead — see [`/DECISIONS.md`](../../../DECISIONS.md).

## Decisions taken

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: decisions -->
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Classical statistics or IRT? | Classical for now | IRT needs far more data per item and a calibration process we cannot staff yet; the interface leaves room to upgrade |
| Allow AI-generated items to auto-publish? | Never | A wrong item teaches a wrong answer to every learner who sees it, and the failure is silent — review is cheap by comparison |
